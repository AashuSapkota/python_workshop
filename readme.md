# Python Django Workshop

Welcome to the **Python Django Workshop**! This repository is designed to guide you through various exercises and learning modules related to both Python and Django development.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

### `django_prc`:
- This directory contains all the resources and files related to **Django**.
- Inside this folder, you'll find:
  - The Django project setup
  - Virtual environment (`venv`)
  
### `python_prc`:
- This directory contains Python basics exercises.
- It includes:
  - Python scripts like `file1.py`, `file2.py`, and `file3.py`
  - Virtual environment (`venv`)

## Branches

- **`main`**: This branch is for general project information and descriptions. It includes the README and other documentation that helps you get started with the workshop.

- **`basics`**: This branch contains the basics of both **Python** and **Django**. You will find introductory exercises and code related to learning fundamental concepts in both technologies.

- **Feature branches**: As development progresses on the Django project, new feature branches will be created. These branches will focus on adding specific features or improvements to the Django project, with each branch dedicated to a particular task or functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with either the **Python** or **Django** sections, make sure to set up the corresponding virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies. Follow the instructions below for each directory.

### Setting Up the Django Environment

1. Navigate to the `django_prc` directory.
2. Activate the virtual environment (`venv`) and install the requirements.

### Setting Up the Python Basics Environment

1. Navigate to the `python_prc` directory.
2. Activate the virtual environment (`venv`) and run the Python scripts.

Enjoy the workshop and happy coding!
